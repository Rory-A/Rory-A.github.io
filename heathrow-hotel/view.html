        The images in this collection were created during the time that I was working at Heathrow airport in my role as a software engineer for a consultancy that the airport had hired. I was living in Birmingham at the time, but the role required that I partly worked in Heathrow airport offices. Therefore, for the year that I was on the project at Heathrow, I stayed in various hotels next to the airport for 3 nights a week. There isn’t much around the airport, and in my hotel room, I felt isolated. It was often a lonely experience, but it was the perfect environment to explore. I fondly remember summer nights spent reading until the early hours, heart-gripped by Korean Manhwas and Japanese Manga (the soppy romantic ones are my favourite, see ‘Doridosim’ and ‘Something About Us’).

        For my photography, this exploration led to abstraction becoming a central part of my practice. I wanted to make images where the subject was the image, not an object inside the image. The subjects come about almost subconsciously. Whilst taking the photograph I only try to follow the direction that I’m being pulled in. It mostly feels like trying to look at something that’s around a corner. It’s only once I go past the corner that I see the subject. I find life to be quite disorientating. Each time I successfully navigate myself to seeing a subject, that disorientation fades a a little.
